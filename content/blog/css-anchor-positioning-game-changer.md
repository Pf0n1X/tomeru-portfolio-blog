# CSS Anchor Positioning â€” A Game Changer for Tooltips & Floating UI

If you've ever tried to position a tooltip exactly above another DOM element, you probably remember the hoops you had to jump through. Between `position: static`, nesting elements, and adjusting with JavaScript to handle scroll, zoom, and resize â€” it was never clean or simple.

ðŸ’¡ Enter CSS Anchor Positioning â€” a new set of CSS properties designed to solve those layout headaches. You can now directly link a floating element (like a tooltip or dropdown) to its anchor using pure CSS.

## New CSS Properties Include:

- `anchor-name`
- `position-anchor`
- `position-area`
- `position-try-fallbacks`
- `position-try-order`
- `position-try` (shorthand)
- `position-visibility`
- `anchor-scope` (not yet implemented)

## Quick Example:

```css
.anchor {
  anchor-name: --some-name;
}

.target {
  position: absolute;
  position-anchor: --some-name;
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Browser support is still evolving â€” but it's improving rapidly.
