# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. When combined with TypeScript, it provides an excellent developer experience with type safety and modern tooling.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves SEO and initial page load times
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for optimal performance
- **API Routes**: Build full-stack applications with built-in API endpoints
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Only loads the JavaScript needed for each page
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images for better performance

## Setting Up TypeScript

Adding TypeScript to your Next.js project is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
```

This command creates a new Next.js project with TypeScript already configured.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js TypeScript project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── pages/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── _app.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── components/
├── styles/
├── public/
├── next.config.js
├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Proper Types**: Always define interfaces for your props and data structures
2. **Leverage Next.js Features**: Make use of built-in optimizations like Image component
3. **Code Organization**: Keep components modular and follow consistent naming conventions
4. **Performance**: Use dynamic imports for code splitting when needed

## Creating Your First Component

Here's an example of a properly typed React component:

```tsx
interface BlogPostProps {
  title: string
  content: string
  publishedAt: Date
}

export function BlogPost({ title, content, publishedAt }: BlogPostProps) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <time>{publishedAt.toLocaleDateString()}</time>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js with TypeScript provides a robust foundation for building modern web applications. The combination of React's component model, Next.js's performance optimizations, and TypeScript's type safety creates an excellent development experience.

Start building your next project with this powerful stack and enjoy the benefits of modern web development!
