# ViewTransition API ‚Äî Smooth, Declarative UI Transitions

üß© The ViewTransition API is a modern web API that enables smooth, declarative transitions between different views or UI states in a single-page application (SPA).

Instead of manually managing animations, developers can use `startViewTransition()` to automatically animate DOM changes‚Äîsuch as switching pages, updating content, or navigating tabs‚Äîwith minimal code. It integrates seamlessly with the browser's rendering pipeline to deliver performant, native-like transitions.

## Usage Example:

```javascript
function handleClick(e) {
  // Fallback for browsers that don't support this API:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateTheDOMSomehow();
    return;
  }

  // With a View Transition:
  document.startViewTransition(() => updateTheDOMSomehow());
}
```

‚ú® View transitions aren't tied to any specific framework‚Äîthey work across different app architectures and even between separate documents.

## How it works:

1. The browser captures snapshots of old and new states
2. DOM updates happen while rendering is paused
3. Transitions are handled with CSS Animations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This feature isn't fully supported across all browsers yet.
